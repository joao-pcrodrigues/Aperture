# Aperture Studios

This website was created under my web development course, which consisted in the creation of a fictional photography studio using:
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- Google Maps API

The photos belong to a dear friend of mine. If you enjoyed them, please give her a follow on instagram @danielaf.fotografia
