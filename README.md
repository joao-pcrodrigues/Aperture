# Aperture Studios

This website was created under my web development online course, which consisted in the creation of a fictional photography studio using javascript.

This project was built with:
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- Google Maps API

The photos belong to a dear friend of mine. If you enjoyed them, please give her a follow on intagram @danielaf.fotografia
